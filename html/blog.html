              Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He
              became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth —
              a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout
              his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to
              gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream
              to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships
              and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by
              the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming
              known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of
              the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading
              him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.

              Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a
              trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly
              tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He
              likes to wear slim fitting clothes. He has a tendency to wear
              shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym
              for the number. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become
              noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in
              his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami
              shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest.
              Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath,
              but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his
              own Shinigami powers. It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and
              bottom. Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including
              Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former
              lieutenant of the 13th Division. After training in the Dangai,
              Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as
              stated by his friends. After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers,
              his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai
              training.

              Izuku Midoriya, also known as Deku, is the main protagonist of the
              My Hero Academia manga and anime series. Even though Izuku was
              born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary
              hero All Might, due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of
              justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a
              student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his
              transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth and current
              holder of One For All. Following the Paranormal Liberation War,
              with Tomura Shigaraki and All For One actively targeting Izuku for
              his Quirk, he decided to leave U.A. before finishing his first
              year to keep his classmates out of harm's way. After encouragement
              and support from his friends, he later returns to the school and
              leads the heroes against the villains in one final, desperate
              battle to save the world.
